# MarkYou — Software Requirements Specification

**Version:** 1.0 · **Date:** 2026-07-24 · **Status:** Approved (decisions locked with product owner)

---

## 1. Overview

MarkYou is a **web-based, local-first WYSIWYG markdown editor**. It gives one document three synchronized views:

1. **Raw mode** — a code editor for the markdown source with a live preview column.
2. **WYSIWYG mode** — a Google-Docs-like rich editing experience that reads and writes markdown.
3. **Dual mode** — raw source on the left, WYSIWYG on the right, editing the same document live.

The product serves developers and non-technical writers equally: writers get a friendly rich editor that never shows them syntax; developers get a first-class source editor — and both always work on the same plain `.md` file that the user owns on disk.

**Product principles**

- **The markdown text is the single source of truth.** Every mode is a projection of it; what raw mode shows is exactly what is saved.
- **Users own their files.** Real `.md` files on the user's disk; no server, no account, fully offline-capable.
- **No data loss, ever.** Continuous local drafts guard every keystroke between explicit saves.
- **One grammar everywhere.** A single markdown parser configuration drives the raw highlighting, the preview, and the WYSIWYG editor, so a document can never render differently between modes.

## 2. Goals and non-goals

### Goals (v1)

- Polished editing in all three modes for the full supported markdown flavor (§6).
- Local-first document lifecycle: open/save real files, drafts, crash recovery, version snapshots.
- Google-Docs-grade WYSIWYG interactions: toolbar, bubble menu, slash commands, drag handles.
- Responsive: full experience on desktop; fully usable single-pane experience on phones/tablets.
- Offline-capable PWA.

### Non-goals (v1) — explicitly out of scope

| Excluded | Reason | Revisit |
|---|---|---|
| Real-time collaboration | Product decision (stated up front) | — |
| Comments / annotations | Requires sidecar data + anchor tracking; large scope | v2 candidate |
| Track changes / suggestions | Same sidecar problem plus diff UX | v2 candidate |
| Publish / share to web | Conflicts with no-server decision | v2 candidate |
| Cloud sync / accounts | v1 is local-first; storage layer is built behind an interface so sync can be added without rewrite | v1.x/v2 |
| Multi-tab, folder workspace | Single-document v1; shell designed so tabs can be added later | v1.x |
| Plugin/extension API | Premature before internals stabilize | v2 |

## 3. Users and personas

| Persona | Description | What they need |
|---|---|---|
| **Dev writer** | Writes READMEs, docs-as-code, technical notes; lives in editors and git | Fast raw mode, GFM fidelity, predictable serialization, keyboard-first |
| **Non-technical writer** | Drafts articles, meeting notes, content; knows Google Docs, not markdown | WYSIWYG that never leaks syntax, familiar toolbar/shortcuts, zero setup |
| **Hybrid** | Technical writer / PM; switches between structure work and source tweaks | Instant mode switching, dual mode, outline navigation |

Defaults follow the "both audiences equally" decision: **WYSIWYG is the default mode for new users; the last-used mode is remembered per device.**

## 4. Decision log

Decisions made interactively with the product owner on 2026-07-24. These are binding for v1.

| # | Topic | Decision | Rationale / rejected alternatives |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Storage | **Local-first**: File System Access API (Chromium) + open/download fallback elsewhere; IndexedDB for drafts, recents, snapshots. Storage behind a provider interface for future cloud sync. | Rejected: in-app-only library (users don't own files), cloud app (doubles scope), drive-sync (OAuth complexity) |
| D2 | Document scope | **Single document** at a time + recent-files list; shell leaves room for tabs later | Rejected for v1: multi-tab, folder workspace |
| D3 | Audience | **Developers and writers equally**; WYSIWYG default, last mode remembered | — |
| D4 | Mobile | **Responsive, desktop-first**: single-pane with mode switcher on small screens; dual mode desktop-only | Rejected: desktop-only, full mobile parity |
| D5 | Markdown flavor | CommonMark + **GFM + Math (KaTeX) + Mermaid + frontmatter + callouts** (§6) | All selected |
| D6 | WYSIWYG UX | **Toolbar + shortcuts + autoformat, bubble menu, slash commands, drag handles** — all in scope | All selected |
| D7 | Document features | **Find & replace, outline + word count, export PDF/HTML, version snapshots** — all in scope | All selected |
| D8 | Big extras | **Images paste/drop only**; comments, track changes, publish rejected | Scope protection |
| D9 | WYSIWYG engine | **Milkdown** (ProseMirror + remark internally) | Markdown-native round-trip; official plugins cover the feature list. Rejected: Tiptap (HTML-native, custom serializer burden), Lexical (shallow markdown), raw ProseMirror (cost), CM6 live-preview hybrid (can't reach Docs feel) |
| D10 | UI framework | **React** + TypeScript | First-class bindings for all editor libs, deepest ecosystem. Rejected: Svelte, Vue, no-framework |
| D11 | Raw editor | **CodeMirror 6** | ~10× lighter than Monaco, real mobile support, first-class markdown mode. Rejected: Monaco |
| D12 | Styling/UI | **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui** (Radix primitives) | Accessible chrome primitives as owned code; CSS-variable theming. Rejected: Mantine/MUI, hand-rolled CSS |
| D13 | Round-trip policy | **Normalize on WYSIWYG edit**: consistent, configurable output style; raw mode never reformats | Rejected for v1: strict byte-preservation (block-level patching — v1.x candidate) |
| D14 | Image storage | **`assets/` folder beside the `.md`** (relative links, portable); automatic base64-embed fallback in non-Chromium browsers | Rejected as primary: base64-only, app-internal storage |
| D15 | Save model | **Explicit Ctrl+S** writes disk; **continuous IndexedDB draft** guards every change; recovery offered on reopen | Rejected: silent autosave-to-disk (v1.x opt-in toggle candidate) |

Supporting stack (architect's picks, owner informed): Vite, TypeScript strict, unified/remark/rehype pipeline, Zustand, Dexie, vite-plugin-pwa, Vitest + Playwright.

## 5. Functional requirements

Requirement IDs are stable and referenced by the implementation plan. "Must" = v1 release blocker.

### FR-1 Document lifecycle

- **FR-1.1** New document: opens an empty untitled doc; first save triggers save-as.
- **FR-1.2** Open: file picker for `.md`/`.markdown`/`.txt`. Chromium: File System Access API with a re-usable handle; other browsers: file input upload.
- **FR-1.3** Save (Ctrl+S): writes in place via the stored handle (Chromium). Fallback browsers: downloads the file ("Save a copy") with clear messaging that in-place save is unavailable.
- **FR-1.4** Save As (Ctrl+Shift+S) with filename suggestion.
- **FR-1.5** Recent files list (welcome screen + menu): name, path hint, last-opened time; reopens via persisted handle with permission re-prompt when required.
- **FR-1.6** Dirty state is always visible (title-bar dot); closing the tab with unsaved changes triggers the browser leave-warning.
- **FR-1.7** **Draft guard:** every change is persisted to IndexedDB within 1 s of idle. If the app reopens and the draft is newer than the file, a recovery banner offers *Restore draft* / *Discard* with a preview diff.
- **FR-1.8** Drag-and-drop of an `.md` file anywhere on the app opens it.

*Acceptance:* kill the tab mid-edit → reopen → recovery banner restores every keystroke. Save on Chromium modifies the original file in place.

### FR-2 Mode shell

- **FR-2.1** Three modes: **Raw**, **WYSIWYG**, **Dual**; switchable via segmented control in the top bar and shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+1/2/3).
- **FR-2.2** Mode switching preserves content exactly (per D13 semantics) and keeps the reading position (best-effort cursor/scroll mapping).
- **FR-2.3** Last-used mode, theme, and layout sizes persist per device.
- **FR-2.4** Dual mode: draggable splitter (default 50/50, persisted); raw left, WYSIWYG right.
- **FR-2.5** Below the small-screen breakpoint (§9), dual mode is unavailable; the shell falls back to single-pane with the mode switcher.

### FR-3 Raw mode (CodeMirror 6)

- **FR-3.1** Markdown syntax highlighting, including nested highlighting of fenced code blocks (top ~15 languages lazy-loaded).
- **FR-3.2** Editing affordances: line numbers (toggle), active-line highlight, bracket/emphasis auto-pairing, list continuation on Enter, Tab/Shift-Tab indent for lists, multiple cursors, undo/redo.
- **FR-3.3** Preview column beside the editor (toggleable, Ctrl+Shift+P), with synchronized scrolling (§FR-4.3).
- **FR-3.4** Raw mode **never reformats** the user's text (D13). Typing and saving are byte-faithful.
- **FR-3.5** Formatting shortcuts operate on source text (Ctrl+B wraps selection in `**`), matching VS Code behavior.

### FR-4 Preview

- **FR-4.1** Renders the full flavor (§6) via the shared unified pipeline; output sanitized (§8 security).
- **FR-4.2** Updates live, debounced ≤ 250 ms after typing stops.
- **FR-4.3** Scroll sync raw↔preview, bidirectional, based on source-position mapping (not percentage).
- **FR-4.4** Preview is the styling reference: WYSIWYG mode and HTML/PDF export share its typography theme.

### FR-5 WYSIWYG mode (Milkdown)

- **FR-5.1** Full editing of the supported flavor with **no markdown syntax visible**: headings, emphasis, links (edit popover), lists, task lists, blockquotes, callouts, tables, code blocks (with language picker + highlighting), math, images, horizontal rules, footnotes.
- **FR-5.2** **Fixed toolbar**: undo/redo, block-type dropdown (paragraph/H1–H6/quote/code), bold, italic, strikethrough, inline code, link, list buttons, task list, table insert, image insert, math insert, more-menu. Reflects the current selection state.
- **FR-5.3** **Keyboard shortcuts**: the Google-Docs/standard set (§9.3) plus **markdown autoformat input rules** — typing `## `, `- `, `1. `, `> `, `` ``` ``, `**bold**`, `$math$` transforms live.
- **FR-5.4** **Bubble menu** on text selection: bold, italic, strikethrough, code, link, and turn-into. Serves as the primary formatting surface on touch devices.
- **FR-5.5** **Slash commands**: `/` opens a filterable insert menu (headings, lists, table, code block, math block, mermaid, callout, image, divider…).
- **FR-5.6** **Drag handles**: hover grip per block for reordering with drop indicator; `+` affordance to insert a block below.
- **FR-5.7** **Tables**: add/remove row/column, header row toggle, column alignment, Tab navigation between cells — via a table-scoped toolbar/popover.
- **FR-5.8** **Math**: inline `$…$` and block `$$…$$` rendered with KaTeX; clicking opens a source popover editor with live preview; invalid LaTeX shows a graceful error chip.
- **FR-5.9** **Mermaid**: rendered read-only in place; click to edit source in a popover with re-render on apply.
- **FR-5.10** **Callouts** (`> [!NOTE|TIP|WARNING|IMPORTANT|CAUTION]`): rendered as styled boxes with icon; type picker; content editable inline.
- **FR-5.11** **Raw HTML blocks/inline** in the source are preserved verbatim and shown as inert, clearly-marked chips with a source-editing popover. HTML is never executed inside the WYSIWYG editor.
- **FR-5.12** **Frontmatter** never appears as body text: it is split off at the document layer and edited via a metadata panel (§FR-10.4).
- **FR-5.13** Copy/paste: pasting rich text (from Docs/Word/web) converts to markdown-backed content; copying out provides both rich text and markdown flavors.
- **FR-5.14** Undo/redo history is per-editing-session and survives mode switches (acceptable v1 simplification: history resets when the *other* pane rewrites the doc in dual mode).

### FR-6 Dual mode synchronization

- **FR-6.1** Both panes edit the same store; edits propagate to the other pane, debounced ≤ 400 ms, without focus steal, echo loops, or visible cursor jumps in the pane being typed in.
- **FR-6.2** WYSIWYG edits re-serialize through the normalization policy (D13); the raw pane therefore shows normalized markdown for edited content. Raw-pane edits never trigger reformatting of untouched text.
- **FR-6.3** Best-effort scroll sync between panes (top-level block mapping).
- **FR-6.4** A document that fails WYSIWYG parsing (pathological input) must never corrupt the store: raw remains editable, WYSIWYG shows a non-blocking error state.

### FR-7 Markdown flavor — see §6 for the normative spec

### FR-8 Images (D14)

- **FR-8.1** Paste or drag-drop an image in any editing mode inserts it at the cursor.
- **FR-8.2** Primary storage: written to `assets/` beside the document (name: `<slug>-<shorthash>.<ext>`), inserted as relative `![](assets/…)`. Requires one-time folder permission (Chromium); the permission prompt explains why.
- **FR-8.3** Fallback (no folder access / non-Chromium): embed as base64 data URI with a per-image size warning above 200 KB.
- **FR-8.4** Relative image paths in opened documents resolve and display when folder access is available; otherwise a placeholder prompts to grant access.
- **FR-8.5** WYSIWYG image UX: click to select, alt-text editing, remove; (resize is v1.x).

### FR-9 Find & replace

- **FR-9.1** Ctrl+F opens a find bar scoped to the active pane; Enter/Shift+Enter cycles matches with highlight + count.
- **FR-9.2** Replace / Replace-all (Ctrl+H) in both raw and WYSIWYG modes.
- **FR-9.3** Raw mode additionally offers regex, case-sensitivity, and whole-word toggles (CodeMirror search).

### FR-10 Outline, counts, metadata

- **FR-10.1** Collapsible outline sidebar listing the heading tree; click scrolls/jumps in the active mode; current section highlighted.
- **FR-10.2** Status bar: words, characters, reading time; selection-scoped counts when a selection exists.
- **FR-10.3** Status bar also shows: cursor line:col (raw), save state ("Saved · 2 min ago" / "Unsaved changes"), markdown flavor indicator.
- **FR-10.4** Frontmatter metadata panel: key/value editing of the YAML block (title, tags, custom); creates/removes the block; invalid YAML falls back to a raw-text editing field with an error notice.

### FR-11 Export

- **FR-11.1** Export → **HTML**: a single self-contained `.html` (inlined styles, KaTeX CSS, pre-rendered Mermaid SVG, embedded images) matching the preview typography.
- **FR-11.2** Export → **PDF**: print-quality output via a dedicated print stylesheet and the browser print-to-PDF dialog (page margins, page-break-avoid rules for code/tables, link URLs in footnotes optional).
- **FR-11.3** Copy as rich text (for pasting into Docs/Word/email).

### FR-12 Version snapshots (local history)

- **FR-12.1** Automatic snapshots to IndexedDB: on every save, and every 5 minutes while dirty. Retention: newest 50 kept verbatim, older thinned (per doc, cap ~200).
- **FR-12.2** History panel: timestamped list with trigger labels (save/auto/restore point).
- **FR-12.3** Selecting a snapshot shows a **diff view** against the current text; one-click restore (current state is snapshotted first).

### FR-13 Settings & theming

- **FR-13.1** Theme: light / dark / system, instant switch, applied across editors and preview.
- **FR-13.2** Markdown style preferences (drives D13 normalization): bullet marker (`-`/`*`/`+`), emphasis marker (`*`/`_`), fence style, list indent, rule style. Defaults: `-`, `*`, backticks.
- **FR-13.3** Editor preferences: font size, line numbers, default mode, draft-autosave interval.
- **FR-13.4** All settings persist locally; a "Reset to defaults" exists.

## 6. Markdown flavor specification (normative)

Baseline **CommonMark**, extended with:

| Extension | Syntax | Raw | Preview | WYSIWYG |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GFM tables | pipe tables | highlight | render | full editing (FR-5.7) |
| GFM task lists | `- [ ]` / `- [x]` | highlight | interactive-looking checkboxes (read-only in preview) | clickable checkboxes |
| GFM strikethrough | `~~x~~` | highlight | render | full |
| GFM autolinks | bare URLs | highlight | linked | linked |
| GFM footnotes | `[^1]` | highlight | rendered with backlinks | insert/edit |
| Math | `$…$`, `$$…$$` (KaTeX) | highlight | render | FR-5.8 |
| Mermaid | ` ```mermaid ` fence | highlight | render (lazy-loaded) | FR-5.9 |
| Frontmatter | leading `---` YAML | highlight | hidden from output | metadata panel (FR-10.4) |
| Callouts | `> [!NOTE]` GitHub/Obsidian style | highlight | styled boxes | FR-5.10 |
| Raw HTML | inline/block | highlight | sanitized render | inert chip (FR-5.11) |

**Round-trip rules (D13):**

1. Raw-mode editing and saving are byte-faithful — the app never rewrites text the user didn't touch in raw mode.
2. Any WYSIWYG edit re-serializes the document body using the style preferences (FR-13.2). Content, structure, and meaning are always preserved; syntax *style* (marker characters, spacing) is normalized.
3. Constructs the WYSIWYG cannot represent (unknown syntax, raw HTML) round-trip **verbatim** — they must never be dropped or mangled.
4. A golden-file round-trip test corpus enforces rules 2–3 in CI (see implementation plan).

## 7. Non-functional requirements

### Performance budgets (mid-range laptop, 100 KB document unless noted)

| Metric | Budget |
|---|---|
| Initial JS (gzipped, excluding lazy KaTeX/Mermaid/language chunks) | ≤ 350 KB |
| First load to interactive (cold, broadband) | ≤ 2 s |
| Keystroke → paint, raw mode | ≤ 16 ms p95 |
| Keystroke → paint, WYSIWYG | ≤ 50 ms p95 |
| Cross-pane sync visible in dual mode | ≤ 500 ms |
| Mode switch | ≤ 300 ms |
| 1 MB document | opens and remains editable (degraded preview debounce acceptable) |

### Reliability

- No user-visible data loss under: tab crash, browser close, power loss (bounded by the ≤ 1 s draft interval), failed save, or WYSIWYG parse failure (FR-6.4).
- Storage errors (permission revoked, disk full, quota) surface as actionable, non-blocking notices.

### Security & privacy

- Preview/export HTML is sanitized (allowlist schema); raw HTML never executes inside editors; KaTeX/Mermaid render without `dangerously`-style injection. No remote content is fetched by documents except explicit image URLs.
- No telemetry, no network calls required for any core function. The app is fully client-side.

### Accessibility

- Target **WCAG 2.1 AA**: complete keyboard operability (toolbar roving tabindex, focus-visible states, Esc closes overlays), ARIA roles on toolbar/menus/dialogs (via Radix), AA contrast in both themes, `prefers-reduced-motion` respected, editor regions labeled for screen readers.

### Browser support matrix

| Tier | Browsers | Experience |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Chrome, Edge (last 2 majors), desktop | Everything incl. in-place save + `assets/` images |
| 2 | Firefox, Safari (last 2 majors), desktop | Full editing; open/"save a copy" fallback; base64 image fallback |
| 3 | iOS Safari, Android Chrome (current) | Responsive single-pane; touch formatting via bubble menu; dual mode unavailable |

### Offline (PWA)

- Installable; app shell, fonts, KaTeX assets precached; previously-used lazy chunks cached. Full functionality offline for Tier-1/2 flows.

## 8. UX specification

### 8.1 Layout — desktop

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ☰  Title (● dirty)          [ Raw | WYSIWYG | Dual ]   ⋯  🌙   │ top bar
├──────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

│          │                        │  WYSIWYG  (Dual mode)      │
├──────────┴────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────┤
│ 1,240 words · 6 min read      L12:C4        Saved · 2 min ago  │ status bar
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- ☰ menu: New, Open, Recent, Save, Save As, Export (HTML/PDF/Copy rich), History, Metadata, Settings.
- WYSIWYG single mode: document centered, max measure ~72ch, generous whitespace — Docs-like page feel.
- Split columns (raw-mode preview, dual-mode WYSIWYG) fill their pane with no measure cap: the divider is the width control there, so dragging it resizes the rendered document itself (FR-2.4). The centred measure belongs to single mode, which has no divider.

### 8.2 Layout — small screens (< 768 px)

Single pane + mode switcher (Raw ⇄ WYSIWYG; no dual, preview replaces raw as a toggle). Toolbar collapses to priority actions + overflow sheet; bubble menu is the primary formatting surface; outline and menus become sheets/drawers. Virtual-keyboard-safe insets (`visualViewport`).

### 8.3 Keyboard shortcuts (v1 set)

| Action | Shortcut | | Action | Shortcut |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Save / Save As | Ctrl+S / Ctrl+Shift+S | | Bold / Italic / Strike | Ctrl+B / Ctrl+I / Ctrl+Shift+X |
| Open / New | Ctrl+O / Ctrl+Alt+N | | Inline code | Ctrl+E |
| Mode: Raw/WYSIWYG/Dual | Ctrl+Shift+1/2/3 | | Link | Ctrl+K |
| Toggle preview (raw) | Ctrl+Shift+P | | Heading 1–3 | Ctrl+Alt+1/2/3 |
| Find / Replace | Ctrl+F / Ctrl+H | | Lists (bullet/ordered/task) | Ctrl+Shift+8/7/9 |
| Outline toggle | Ctrl+Shift+O | | Undo / Redo | Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y |
| Slash menu | `/` at block start | | Quote | Ctrl+Shift+B |

(macOS: Cmd equivalents.) A searchable shortcut sheet lives under ⋯ → "Keyboard shortcuts".

### 8.4 Visual design

- Clean, content-first, Docs-adjacent: neutral chrome, document surface elevated on subtle background; Tailwind Typography-derived document theme shared by preview/WYSIWYG/export.
- Light/dark via CSS variables; system font stack for UI, user-selectable content font (serif/sans/mono) is v1.x.

## 9. Release criteria (v1 definition of done)

1. All "Must" FRs pass acceptance checks on the Tier-1 matrix; Tier-2/3 pass their scoped experiences.
2. Round-trip golden corpus: 100% pass (rules in §6).
3. Performance budgets met (§7) on the reference fixture set, enforced in CI.
4. Accessibility audit (axe + manual keyboard pass) with no serious violations.
5. E2E suite green: lifecycle, all three modes, dual-mode sync, images, export, recovery flows.
6. Zero known data-loss bugs.

## 10. Roadmap after v1 (non-binding)

- **v1.x:** multi-tab · autosave-to-disk toggle (D15 alt) · strict byte-preservation via block-level patching (D13 alt) · image resize · content font options · folder workspace (explorer sidebar)
- **v2:** optional cloud sync provider behind the storage interface · comments sidecar · publish/share · plugin API
